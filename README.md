## What have I learned with the project?
#### MySQL
The program stores information in a MySQL database. Learned how to create Databases, Tables and `INSERT` and check for records using `SELECT` command
## Setting up
Besides `Python`, you will need two libraries installed in your machine:
* MySQL
* Regex
With `pip` you can install them using the following command in your `cmd`:
```
pip install mysql regex
```
